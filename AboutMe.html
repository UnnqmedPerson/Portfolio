        <p>
            I am currently a third year student attending California State University of Fullerton. <br>
            Right now, I am still looking for what I want to do in the future as a career and I am hoping that I would
            be able to find my passion by the time I graduate from this unviersity.
        </p>

            Outside of school, I like to spend my time talking with friends or playing video games. The main types of 
            games that I like to play right now are mainly FPS and RPGs and when I want a change of pace I would play some 
            more casual games.
